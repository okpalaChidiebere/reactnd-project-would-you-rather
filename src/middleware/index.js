/*
Itâ€™s important to note that the value of the next parameter will be determined by the 
applyMiddleware function. Why? All middleware will be called in the order it is listed 
in that function. In our case, the next will be dispatch because logger is the last 
middleware listed in that function.
if you have logger befor thunk, the behaviour of the middleware will be different
